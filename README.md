# Telecom Postpaid Plan Eligibility Bootcamp

**IBM watsonx Orchestrate**

> **Postpaid Plan Eligibility Processing | AI Agent Development Bootcamp**
>
> **Goal:** By the end of this lab, you will have built, deployed, and tested an AI Agentic workflow for Postpaid Plan Eligibility Use case on watsonx Orchestrate — a 3-agent pipeline that reads Emirates ID and payslip documents, validates eligibility requirements, recommends eligible plan tiers, and processes payment via Stripe payment gateway.

---

## Use Case Overview

Telecom operators process thousands of postpaid plan applications every
month. Today this usually means a customer submits a national ID and a
recent payslip, then waits while a back-office team manually checks
identity validity, cross-references the applicant's details across
documents, verifies income, and decides which plans they qualify for.

This lab builds an AI agentic workflow that automates the process for a
fictional telecom operator, **Connectel**, end to end — from document
upload and processing going through plan recommendation to final payment.

**Who this is for:** customer onboarding, credit risk, and digital
channel teams at telecom operators looking to move postpaid sign-up
from manual back-office review into a self-service, real-time
conversational flow — without losing the underlying compliance checks
a manual process would normally perform.

**What the system does, end to end:**

1. A customer uploads their Emirates ID and a recent payslip.
2. The workflow extracts the relevant fields and runs the same checks a
   back-office reviewer would: ID validity, a name match across both
   documents, and a minimum income threshold.
3. If the applicant doesn't qualify, they get a clear justification
   immediately instead of a multi-day wait.
4. If they qualify, the system returns every plan tier they're eligible
   for based on income, not just one suggested plan.
5. Once the customer selects and confirms a plan, the system generates
   a payment link and confirms the subscription in the same conversation.

> **Note:** The plan names, salary thresholds, and credit limit figures
> used in this lab are illustrative — not a real operator's published
> rate card.

## 1. What is watsonx Orchestrate?

IBM watsonx Orchestrate is an open, hybrid enterprise platform for agentic AI. It lets you build intelligent agents that can:

- Reason and make decisions
- Call external tools and APIs
- Process documents automatically
- Run structured, multi-step workflows

### Development Approaches

| Approach | Description |
|---|---|
| No-code | Drag-and-drop UI agent builder |
| Chat to build | Create agents via natural language prompting |
| Pro-code (ADK) | Full control via the Agent Development Kit |
| Flow-builder | Visual agentic workflow builder |

> In this bootcamp we use **No-code UI** for agents, **Flow-builder** for document extraction workflow, and **ADK** for the payment tool.

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

We will build a **Postpaid Plan Eligibility Workflow** — a 3-agent pipeline that processes identity documents, validates eligibility, and processes payment.

## 3. What Gets Checked?

| # | Check | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Emirates ID validity** | Must be valid for 90+ days from today |
| 2 | **Name cross-check** | Name on Emirates ID must match payslip employee name |
| 3 | **Salary threshold** | Gross salary must be ≥ 4000 AED |

If all checks pass, the system retrieves eligible plan tiers from the knowledge base based on the customer's salary and presents them for selection.

---

## Prerequisites

---

## Part 1 — Build Sub-Agent 1: Payment Agent

### 1.1 Create the Agent

In the watsonx Orchestrate UI:

1. Click the **☰ hamburger menu** → under **Active Inventory**, click **Agents**
2. Click **Create agent**
3. Click **Build with Bob** — your browser will show a prompt asking to open an `ibm-bob://` link → click **Open Link**
   <img width="3356" height="1850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65f547bc-ef4d-4d75-94d5-6964f5aa11f5" />
   <img width="3358" height="1854" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2225211d-f44c-466b-9d2c-0a7fbbb43c08" />
4. **Bob IDE opens** — inside Bob IDE a pop-up appears asking to install the **watsonx Orchestrate ADK** extension → click **Install Extension and Open URI**
   <img width="3354" height="1536" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c25a76fa-2c71-46f0-b199-dd818977bf0e" />
   <img width="996" height="616" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c01393d9-ae58-4069-9c41-5e35410ef06b" />
5. Bob IDE prompts you to select a folder to open — create or select a folder on your machine. After activating the API key, Bob switches to the main Orchestrate workspace folder automatically.
6. Bob IDE then prompts for your API key for the environment — enter it and press **Enter**
   <img width="1292" height="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ff599b6-44b3-44c2-bdec-dc59fb794365" />
7. Once the environment is connected, you should be able to see the workspace in Bob IDE
   <img width="3338" height="1864" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/665a537e-7f68-419f-bc3e-e59b37b53465" />
8. A new task opens in Bob IDE — paste the following prompt:
   <img width="652" height="884" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb2ae48b-927b-49e2-a4ed-a47ee57c7c5c" />

> ⚠️ Replace `<your_last_name>` in the prompt below with your last name before pasting. **Example:** `create_payment_link_ahmed`, `payment_agent_ahmed`

```
Create the payment agent for the postpaid eligibility lab on watsonx Orchestrate: a Python tool create_payment_link_<your_last_name>(plan_name, subscription_aed) and a native agent payment_agent_<your_last_name> that uses it (model groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b).

The tool creates a Stripe test-mode Payment Link — a short buy.stripe.com link, never a checkout session — for the plan's monthly subscription in AED, and returns status, payment_url, link_id and reason without ever raising. Stripe test key to embed in the code: sk_test_51Tls7GRriMoAjNdV3T7efWnrIBRQLDuGUEcfXk4oJHQhVAVxjpMv8FDstHZ0qHonFTmqjI9bT5OJ8pwmbnfRmgEj00iPaeMGpY

The agent, given a plan name and monthly subscription, calls the tool once and replies with only a markdown link whose text is "Click here to pay for <plan name>" and whose target is the payment_url exactly as returned; on failure it says the link could not be created and why. It never asks for card details or writes a URL itself.

Import both, then prove it: create a link for "Smart 150" at 150 AED and confirm through the Stripe API that it is active for 15000 fils in AED. Show me the tool output and the Stripe confirmation.
```

After sending the prompt, Bob will guide you through a series of approval steps:

9. For the purpose of this demo, approve any request Bob presents
   <img width="702" height="154" alt="Screenshot 2026-09-23 093950" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53dd236a-a56a-490c-bc46-f960054dda90" />
10. When prompted to approve command execution — scroll down, select **"I understand the risk"** at the bottom right, then click **Approve**
   <img width="756" height="583" alt="Screenshot 2026-09-23 094620" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d219b43-202c-4738-afea-f6f49e33f292" />


> ⚠️ **Demo environment only.** Selecting "I understand the risk" grants Bob permission to execute terminal commands. This is safe in this controlled lab environment — you are explicitly approving this action as part of the demo setup.

---

## Part 2 — Build Sub-Agent 2: Document Agent

> 🔙 Go back to the watsonx Orchestrate browser page you had open previously before continuing with the steps below.

---

### 2.1 Create the Agent

```
☰ Hamburger menu → under Active Inventory, click Agents → Create agent → From scratch
```
<img width="1237" height="701" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6cf751f-bd77-4b52-87d2-1f031e984354" />
<img width="1311" height="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/112dfb9f-9ae8-4c12-8b76-2f532fc5260a" />


| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `document_agent_<your_last_name> (eg: document_agent_ahmed)`|
| Description | Extracts structured information from uploaded Emirates ID documents and payslips for postpaid eligibility verification. Reads Emirates ID and extracts full name, ID number, date of birth, expiry date. Reads payslip and extracts employee name, company name, gross salary, pay period. Returns all extracted fields in structured format for downstream eligibility validation. |

---

### 2.2 Add the Instructions

Click the **Instructions** tab and paste:

```
Call document_extract_tool ALWAYS.

After document_extract_tool finishes, inspect the eligibility status before responding to the user.

If eligibility status is PASS, DO NOT respond yet. You MUST immediately call get_postpaid_plans exactly once, wait for its result, complete the plan verification steps below, and only then return the final response to the user.

If eligibility status is FAIL, return the extracted fields and rejection reason without calling get_postpaid_plans.

Do not produce any user-facing response between the document_extract_tool call and the get_postpaid_plans tool call when eligibility status is PASS.

Always show the extracted fields and eligibility status.

If eligibility status is FAIL:
Do not retrieve plans.
Only explain the rejection reason.

If eligibility status is PASS:

STEP 1 — Retrieve:
You MUST call the get_postpaid_plans tool before doing any plan analysis or generating the final response. This tool call is mandatory whenever the eligibility status is PASS. Do not skip this tool call for any reason, and do not proceed to STEP 2 until the get_postpaid_plans tool has successfully returned its output.

Call the get_postpaid_plans tool exactly once. It returns a JSON string with a "plans" key containing a list of plan objects (plan, min_salary_aed, monthly_rental_aed, credit_limit_aed). Do not use prior knowledge, conversation context, cached information, or knowledge base search to obtain or infer the plan list — the get_postpaid_plans tool is the only source of truth for plans.

The tool output is a raw JSON string. Do not display it. Parse it internally before doing anything else.

STEP 2 — Analyse and verify (do this internally before responding, do not show this to the user):
Parse the JSON string returned by get_postpaid_plans. Extract the list under the "plans" key. Then reason through each record:
- Check whether the plan name, rental amount, and credit limit are all present, non-empty, and non-zero. If any field is missing or zero, exclude that record.
- Reason explicitly about internal consistency: a higher rental should correspond to a higher minimum salary and credit limit. Flag and exclude any record that looks inconsistent.
- If any two records share the same plan name or rental amount, keep only one instance.

STEP 3 — Present final output (this is the only thing shown to the user):
Only after completing Step 2, present the results to the user in this exact order:

First, show the extracted user details from the workflow output:
- Full Name
- ID Number
- Nationality
- Date of Birth
- Expiry Date
- Employee Name
- Gross Salary

Then, show the verified eligible plans formatted as a markdown table with three columns: Plan, Monthly Rental (AED), Credit Limit (AED). Populate each row from the parsed plan objects — never paste the raw JSON string:

| Plan | Monthly Rental (AED) | Credit Limit (AED) |
|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... |

The final plans table must contain only plans that:
  - Have a minimum salary at or below the customer's gross salary, AND
  - Have complete, valid field values that are internally consistent.

Return all eligible plans that passed both checks — never omit a qualifying plan, and never include a plan that failed either check.
If after verification no plans pass both checks, say so clearly and do not fabricate a result.

Never output the raw JSON string from get_postpaid_plans to the user under any circumstances. Only the formatted markdown table is shown.

Do not show any reasoning, intermediate steps, retrieval results, plan counts, or internal checks to the user — only the user details and the formatted plans table.

After presenting the final output, return the complete raw output from the document_extract_tool workflow exactly as received, without modification. Do not call any payment tool or initiate any payment step — payment is handled by a separate agent.
```

---

### 2.3 Verify Agent Style

Scroll down on the agent page → click **Advanced settings** → confirm **Style** is set to `React Core`. If not, click the dropdown and select it.

<img width="682" height="731" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02dc153b-aa04-4a47-bdac-9a112769a3c4" />

---

### 2.4 Import Knowledge Base Tool

> 📌 This tool acts as the knowledge base for the agent — it connects directly to Milvus and retrieves the full postpaid plan catalogue deterministically, replacing a conversational knowledge base lookup.

This step imports `get_postpaid_plans` — a Python tool that queries the Milvus plans database and returns the full plan catalogue.

---

#### Step 1 — Create the tool file

In the current workspace in Bob IDE, create a new file **under the `tools` folder**:

```
tools/ → New File → name it: get_postpaid_plans.py
```

> ⚠️ Replace `<your_last_name>` with your last name before saving. **Example:** `name="get_postpaid_plans_ahmed"`

Paste this code:

```python
"""Deterministic postpaid-plan lookup for the e& eligibility demo.

Queries the Client Engineering Milvus instance (161.156.199.100:8080, gRPC+TLS)
directly and returns the full plan catalogue as JSON.

Then save the file (`Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`).

---

#### Step 2 — Create the requirements file

In the same `tools` folder, create a new file:

```
tools/ → New File → name it: requirements_kb.txt
```

Paste and save:

```
pymilvus==2.6.1
```

Your `tools` folder should now look like:

```
tools/
├── get_postpaid_plans.py
└── requirements_kb.txt
```

---

#### Step 3 — Import the tool

In your terminal:

```bash
orchestrate tools import --kind python -r tools/requirements_kb.txt -f tools/get_postpaid_plans.py
```
<img width="1118" height="94" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b6b9eb2-20de-4a5b-b290-aaef7c62018e" />

Verify the tool was imported — go to your browser:

```
☰ Hamburger menu → under Active Inventory, click Tools → get_postpaid_plans_<your_last_name>
```

If it appears in the list, the tool is ready. ✅

---

#### Step 4 — Add the tool to document_agent

```

**System Prompt:**

```
You are a data packaging assistant for telecom eligibility processing.
Your only job is to combine extracted document data into a clean JSON object.
You must return only valid JSON. No explanation, no commentary, no extra text.
Never modify, correct, or interpret any field values.
Always preserve the exact values as given to you.
```

**User Prompt:**

```
Combine the two documents into a single JSON object that has exactly three top‑level keys: **emirates_id**, **payslip**, and **eligibility**.

**Emirates ID data** (replace the placeholders with the actual values):
- ID Number: {self.input.id_number}
- Full Name: {self.input.full_name}
- Date of Birth: {self.input.date_of_birth}
- Nationality: {self.input.nationality}
- Expiry Date: {self.input.expiry_date}

**Payslip data** (replace the placeholders with the actual values):
- Employee Name: {self.input.employee_name}
- Gross Salary: {self.input.gross_salary}

**Eligibility data** (replace the placeholders with the actual values; if a value is not available, use an empty string `""`):
- Status: {self.input.status}
- Reason: {self.input.reason}

**Return only** the following JSON structure—no extra text, no formatting, and no additional keys:

{
  "emirates_id": {self.input.
    "id_number": "{self.input.id_number}",
    "full_name": "{self.input.full_name}",
    "date_of_birth": "{self.input.date_of_birth}",
    "nationality": "{self.input.nationality}",
    "expiry_date": "{self.input.expiry_date}"
  },
  "payslip": {self.input.
    "employee_name": "{self.input.employee_name}",
    "gross_salary": "{self.input.gross_salary}"
  },
  "eligibility": {self.input.
    "status": "{self.input.status}",
    "reason": "{self.input.reason}"
  }
}

**RULE:**
- **Always** output every field shown above (`id_number`, `full_name`, `date_of_birth`, `nationality`, `expiry_date`, `employee_name`, `gross_salary`, `status`, `reason`).
- If a particular value is unknown or not provided, insert an empty string (`""`) for that field.
- Do **not** omit any keys, do **not** add extra keys, and do **not** include any explanatory text or markdown formatting. The response must be a plain JSON object exactly as shown.

## Part 3 — Build the Master Agent

### 3.1 Create the Agent

```
☰ Hamburger menu → under Active Inventory, click Agents → Create agent → From scratch
```

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `Postpaid Eligibility Agent_<your_last_name> (eg: Postpaid_Eligibility_Agent_ahmed)`|
| Description | Helps users check eligibility for postpaid plans and complete sign-up. Collects Emirates ID and payslip, verifies identity and income requirements, recommends eligible plan tiers, and processes payment for the plan the user selects. |

---

### 3.2 Add the Instructions

Click the **Instructions** tab and paste:

```
You are the Postpaid Plan Eligibility assistant.
You are the only agent that communicates with the user.
You manage the full postpaid eligibility and sign-up flow step by step.

PHASE 0 — Kickoff:
Call document_agent immediately at the very start of every conversation, with no greeting or message of your own first. document_agent owns the document upload, extraction, eligibility checking, and knowledge base plan lookup entirely through its own workflow and behavior.

PHASE 1 — Document extraction and eligibility check:
  - Triggered immediately and automatically at the very start of the conversation. Do not send any message of your own first, and do not wait for any input before calling document_agent.
  - Call document_agent immediately. document_agent will handle asking the user to upload their Emirates ID and payslip, run its own extraction workflow, check eligibility, and — if eligible — retrieve matching plans from its knowledge base.
  - Wait for document_agent to return its full result. Do not interject, ask your own questions, or duplicate any upload prompts while document_agent is handling this phase.
  - As soon as document_agent returns a result, proceed immediately to Phase 2 in the same turn — do not pause and do not wait for any additional input.
  - If document_agent returns INCOMPLETE or fails to extract a required field, relay that back to the user clearly so they know what to re-upload. Do not proceed to Phase 2 until extraction succeeds.

PHASE 2 — Deliver result:
  Once you receive the result from document_agent:

  If the result is a decline:
    - Clearly explain the decline reason to the user in plain language.
    - Do not proceed further. Do not call payment_agent. Do not ask the user to pick a plan.

  If the result is a list of eligible tiers:
    - Present every eligible tier as a markdown table with columns: Plan, Monthly Rental (AED), Credit Limit (AED).
    - Beneath the table, add one short recommendation line suggesting the highest eligible tier as the best value (e.g. "Based on your eligibility, [highest plan name] offers the most data and the highest credit limit for your budget."). This is a suggestion only — it must not replace or skip showing the full table of all eligible tiers above it.
    - Ask the user which plan they would like to proceed with.
    - Never pre-select, assume, or recommend only the highest tier as if it were the only option — all eligible tiers must be shown.
    - Wait for the user to name one specific plan before proceeding. If their answer doesn't clearly match one of the listed plans, ask them to choose again from the listed options.

PHASE 3 — Plan confirmation:
  - Once the user names one specific eligible plan, do NOT call payment_agent yet. First present a confirmation summary of that plan, in this format:

    "Here is the plan you've selected:
    - Plan: [plan name]
    - Monthly Rental: [rental amount] AED
    - Credit Limit: [credit limit] AED

    Kindly type "Confirm" to proceed with payment."

  - Wait for the user to type "confirm" (accept reasonable case variations, e.g. "Confirm", "confirm", "CONFIRM"). Do not call payment_agent until the user has typed it.
  - If the user wants to switch to a different eligible plan instead of confirming, update the selection and show the confirmation summary again for the newly chosen plan. Always re-confirm before proceeding.
  - As soon as the user types "confirm", proceed directly and immediately to Phase 4 in the same turn. Do not pause, do not ask any further questions, and do not wait for any additional user input before calling payment_agent.

PHASE 4 — Payment:
  - Triggered immediately and automatically the moment the user types "confirm" in Phase 3. Do not wait for any other input.
  - Call payment_agent immediately. Pass the plan details as a single labeled string in this exact format:

    "Plan: [plan name]
    Monthly Rental: [monthly rental amount] AED"

    Example:

    "Plan: Smart 150
    Monthly Rental: 150 AED"

  - Use the exact plan name and exact rental amount as returned by document_agent. Never invent, round, or alter the rental amount. Never include the credit limit in this string — only the plan name and the monthly rental amount with the AED unit.
  - Once payment_agent responds, if status is CREATED, begin your message with exactly this line: "Thank you, please proceed with the payment using the following link:" — then on the next line, output payment_agent's response exactly as-is, with no changes whatsoever. Do not summarize it, do not rephrase it, do not regenerate the link, and do not add your own wording around it beyond the exact opening line specified above.
  - CRITICAL: Treat payment_agent's entire response as an opaque block of text that you copy, not text that you read, understand, or reason about. Do not attempt to parse, interpret, decode, or analyze the URL inside it. Do not try to determine what the URL "means" or whether it "looks complete." Your only job with this block of text is character-for-character copying — never regeneration. If you find yourself reasoning step by step about the structure or content of the URL, stop that reasoning immediately and instead copy the original text directly. The correct process is: take payment_agent's response, copy it, paste it into your reply unchanged. Do not retype it from memory, do not summarize it and then expand it back out, do not describe it and then reconstruct it. Treat it the same way you would treat copying a block of text without reading it.
  - Never ask the user "would you like me to generate a payment link" or any similar confirmatory question before calling payment_agent. Once the user has typed "confirm" in Phase 3, proceed directly to generating and presenting the payment link — do not ask again.
  - The URL inside the payment link is long and may look unfamiliar or repetitive after a "#" character. This is normal, expected, and not a display error to fix. You must never insert an ellipsis ("...", "…"), never insert any "and so on" style abbreviation, never insert any invisible or zero-width characters, and never substitute any portion of the real URL with a shorter placeholder, a made-up fragment, or anything that merely resembles the original pattern. The URL must be reproduced as one single unbroken sequence of the exact characters payment_agent provided, with nothing added, nothing removed, and nothing replaced — including inside the part of the URL after the "#" symbol. A URL that is shorter than what payment_agent returned is always wrong, with no exceptions.
  - If the user changes their mind after receiving a payment link and names a different eligible plan instead, treat this as a new selection: return to Phase 3 and present the exact confirmation summary template again for the newly chosen plan (do not phrase this as a casual question like "would you like me to generate a new link"). Wait for a fresh "confirm" from the user, then repeat Phase 4 and call payment_agent again. Do not refer back to the previous link.

FORMATTING:
Always format your messages clearly and readably. When presenting eligible plans, list them as bullet points, not as a single paragraph. Use line breaks generously so the message is easy to scan rather than a wall of text.

Rules you must always follow:
- Never skip Phase 0. Always call document_agent immediately at the very start of the conversation, with no message of your own first.
- Never ask the user to upload documents yourself, list document requirements, or duplicate document_agent's upload workflow — document_agent owns that conversation entirely, including eligibility checks and plan lookup.
- Never call payment_agent before the user has explicitly named one specific plan from the eligible list AND typed "confirm" in Phase 3. Both steps are required, in that order.
- Never call payment_agent if document_agent returned a decline.
- Never present only one eligible tier if document_agent returned more than one — always show the full list.
- Always pass plan details to payment_agent as a labeled string in the exact format "Plan: [plan name]" followed by "Monthly Rental: [monthly rental amount] AED" on the next line — for example "Plan: Smart 150 / Monthly Rental: 150 AED". Never pass them as a single unlabeled comma-separated value, a sentence, or any other format.
- Once payment_agent responds, output its response unchanged as your message to the user — no summarizing, rephrasing, or regenerating any part of it, including the link. Treat payment_agent's output as an opaque block to copy, never as text to read and retype from understanding. A reproduced URL that is shorter than, different from, or only resembles the original is always a failure, with no exceptions.
- Never narrate or list data being passed between agents.
- Never make up or assume any information not provided by the user or returned by an agent.
- Never perform document extraction, eligibility checks, or payment creation yourself — always delegate to the relevant specialist agent.
- Always be polite and professional throughout.

MANDATORY:
- Always use the complete raw payment link provided by payment_agent VERBATIM, character for character, with zero substitutions anywhere in the string — including inside the encoded portion after the "#" symbol. Even a single character changed, added, or dropped makes the link non-functional, so there is no acceptable margin of error when reproducing it.
